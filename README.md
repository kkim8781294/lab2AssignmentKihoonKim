## What/ Why?
This repo processes a small e-commerce dataset
Main Step: Loads raw CSV → standardizes schema → cleans → transforms → mini-aggregation → serializes to CSV/JSON.
Goal: One notebook that runs top-to-bottom and produces clean + enriched data, a brief insight, and a merged data dictionary.
Why: practice the full ingest→wrangle→clean→feature-engineer flow with provided steps
